# Envoys Realm: Current Implementation Plan (BFF & Shared Header)

* **Version:** 1.1.0 (Reflecting BFF API v1.1.0)
* **Date:** 2025-05-05
* **Author:** EnvoyOfHell (Compiled by AI Assistant)
* **Status:** In Development (BFF API Core Functional, Header Rendering Implemented, Auth Pending)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose

This document details the current technical implementation plan and status for key components of the "Envoys Realm" unified web ecosystem project. It focuses specifically on:

* The **Cloudflare Worker Backend-for-Frontend (BFF)** service (`cloudflare-worker-bff`).
* The **API-driven Shared Header** strategy and its client-side implementation for static sites.

This document supersedes relevant sections of the initial planning documents (`Integrated Web Ecosystem Blueprint`, `Modular SSO Implementation Plan`, `Shared Header Implementation Strategy`, `Hybrid Web Ecosystem Research Plan`) by reflecting the actual code developed, architectural choices made, and troubleshooting outcomes as of the date above. It serves as a technical reference for developers, collaborators, and future maintenance efforts.

### 1.2. Goals Achieved (Current State)

* Established the foundational Cloudflare Worker BFF project structure.
* Implemented a working API endpoint (`/api/header-data`) within the BFF to serve structured data for the shared header.
* Defined data structures for branding, navigation (including dropdowns and placeholders), user state, and header actions.
* Separated static navigation data into `navigationData.ts` for better organization.
* Implemented dynamic "active state" calculation for navigation items based on the request URL.
* Implemented a `/random` endpoint for redirecting to a random valid internal page.
* Developed a client-side JavaScript rendering script (`render-header.js`) to consume the API data and inject the header into static HTML pages.
* Developed a corresponding CSS file (`shared-header.css`) using CSS variables and custom classes to style the rendered header, including basic light/dark theme support.
* Implemented JavaScript-based theme toggling (persisted via `localStorage`) and dropdown menu handling in `render-header.js`.
* Resolved initial runtime errors (`hanging Promise`) in the `wrangler dev` environment by adopting manual routing within the Worker instead of relying on `itty-router`.

### 1.3. Key Pending Items

* Implementation of real user authentication logic (`getUserData` function in BFF) via secure cookie validation and interaction with the planned PHP SSO service.
* Implementation of server-side theme preference reading (e.g., from user cookie) in the BFF (`getThemePreference` function).
* Fetching branding and navigation data from dynamic sources (CMS, config files, database) instead of placeholders/static definitions.
* Integration of the shared header into the modern frontend hub (Next.js/Svelte) and legacy PHP applications (MyBB, WordPress, MediaWiki).
* Refinement of CSS styling and responsiveness.
* Implementation of robust error handling and logging.
* Configuration of production CORS headers.
* Deployment of the BFF Worker and shared assets to production environments.

## 2. Confirmed Architecture

### 2.1. Hosting Strategy: Hybrid

The project continues with the planned hybrid hosting model:

* **Ionos (or similar traditional hosting):** Hosts legacy PHP/MySQL applications (MyBB, WordPress, MediaWiki) and the **central PHP SSO service** (yet to be built).
* **Cloudflare:** Hosts modern components:
    * **Pages:** Main frontend hub (Next.js/Svelte), static utility sites (Pokedex, Clicker, etc.), Image Gallery frontend.
    * **Workers:** The **`cloudflare-worker-bff`** service detailed in this document.
    * **R2:** Centralized storage for static assets (images, shared CSS/JS like `render-header.js` and `shared-header.css`).

### 2.2. Repository Structure: Polyrepo

A polyrepository structure remains the chosen approach:

* `cloudflare-worker-bff`: Contains the Worker code (`src/index.ts`, `src/navigationData.ts`), configuration (`wrangler.toml`, `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`), and this README.
* `php-sso-service`: (To be created) Will contain the central PHP authentication logic.
* `frontend-hub-nextjs` / `frontend-hub-svelte`: (To be created/updated) The main modern UI.
* `mybb-sso-plugin`, `wordpress-sso-plugin`, `mediawiki-sso-extension`: (To be created) Integration components for legacy apps.
* `static-site-*` or `web-tools-collection`: Repositories for the individual static utility sites.
* `shared-header-assets`: (Optional but Recommended) A dedicated repository to manage and potentially deploy the shared `render-header.js` and `shared-header.css` files via GitHub Pages or push them to R2.

## 3. Cloudflare Worker BFF Implementation (`cloudflare-worker-bff`)

### 3.1. Purpose and Role

This Worker acts as the primary API gateway and data aggregation point for the ecosystem's frontends. It shields frontends from direct interaction with potentially complex or sensitive backend services (like the PHP SSO validator).

* Provides the `/api/header-data` endpoint.
* Provides the `/random` redirect endpoint.
* (Future) Will validate user session cookies.
* (Future) Will proxy requests for profile management or other data to the PHP SSO service or other backends.

### 3.2. Project Setup Files

* **`package.json`**: Defines project metadata, scripts (`dev`, `deploy`, `build`), and dependencies (`dependencies`, `devDependencies`). Crucially includes `typescript`, `wrangler`, and `@cloudflare/workers-types`. The `build` script uses `tsc -p .`.
    * *(See canvas `package-json-bff` for full content)*
* **`wrangler.toml`**: Configures Wrangler. Defines the worker `name`, entry point (`main = "src/index.ts"`), `compatibility_date`, and specifies the build command (`command = "npm run build"`).
    * *(See canvas `wrangler-toml-bff` for full content)*
* **`tsconfig.json`**: Configures the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`). Specifies target (`ESNext`), module system (`ESNext`), included files (`src/**/*.ts`), necessary `types` (`@cloudflare/workers-types`), and compiler options (`strict`, `noEmit`, etc.).
    * *(See canvas `tsconfig-json-bff` for full content)*
* **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git (e.g., `node_modules`, `.wrangler`, `.env*`).
    * *(See canvas `gitignore-bff` for full content)*

### 3.3. Core Logic (`src/index.ts`)

* **Entry Point:** Exports a default object with an `async fetch(request, env, ctx)` handler.
* **Routing:** Implements **manual routing** based on `request.method` and `url.pathname`. This approach was chosen after encountering persistent runtime errors with `itty-router` in the `wrangler dev` environment.
* **Data Aggregation:** Uses `Promise.all` within the `/api/header-data` handler to concurrently call asynchronous helper functions (`getBrandingData`, `getNavigationData`, etc.).
* **Response Handling:** Uses the standard `Response` constructor to generate JSON responses (`new Response(JSON.stringify(...), { headers: {...} })`) and redirects (`Response.redirect(...)`). Includes basic `try...catch` block for error handling.
    * *(See canvas `cloudflare-worker-bff-api` for full code)*

### 3.4. Navigation Data (`src/navigationData.ts`)

* **Purpose:** Defines the static structure of the site's navigation menu as an exported constant array (`siteNavigation`).
* **Structure:** Uses the `NavItem` interface (which should be defined consistently here and in `index.ts`, or imported from a shared types file). Supports `link`, `dropdown`, and `placeholder` types, grouping (`main`, `resources`, `user`), nesting (`children`), external links (`target: '_blank'`), and disabling items (`disabled: true`).
* **Maintainability:** Separating this data makes it easier to update navigation links without modifying the core Worker logic.
    * *(See canvas `navigation-data-ts` for full code)*

### 3.5. API Endpoints

* **`GET /api/header-data`**
    * **Request:** Standard GET request. The Worker implicitly receives browser cookies.
    * **Processing:** Calls helper functions (`getBrandingData`, `getNavigationData`, `getUserData`, `getHeaderActions`, `getThemePreference`) via `Promise.all`. Calculates `isActive` state for navigation items.
    * **Response:** `200 OK` with JSON body conforming to `HeaderDataResponse` interface. Includes `Cache-Control: no-store, private` and basic CORS headers (currently `*`, **needs restriction for production**).
* **`OPTIONS /api/header-data`**
    * **Request:** CORS preflight request.
    * **Response:** `204 No Content` with appropriate CORS headers (`Allow-Origin`, `Allow-Methods`, `Allow-Headers`, `Max-Age`). **`Allow-Origin` needs restriction for production.**
* **`GET /random`**
    * **Request:** Standard GET request.
    * **Processing:** Reads `siteNavigation`, filters for valid, non-disabled, non-placeholder, local URLs using `getAllValidLocalUrls`. Selects one randomly.
    * **Response:** `302 Found` redirect to the selected absolute URL. Redirects to `/` as a fallback if no valid URLs are found.

### 3.6. Helper Functions (Current State: Placeholders)

* `getBrandingData()`: Returns hardcoded branding info. (TODO: Fetch dynamically).
* `getNavigationData()`: Imports `siteNavigation`, deep copies it, calculates `isActive` state based on request URL, returns the processed array. (TODO: Fetch structure dynamically).
* `getUserData()`: Returns hardcoded `{ isAuthenticated: false, ... }`. (TODO: Implement cookie validation & PHP SSO interaction).
* `getHeaderActions()`: Returns hardcoded action flags/URLs. (TODO: Implement dynamic logic if needed).
* `getThemePreference()`: Returns `undefined`. (TODO: Implement reading theme preference from cookie/user settings).
* `getAllValidLocalUrls()`: Filters the navigation structure for redirectable URLs. Logic checks for `link` type, non-disabled, non-placeholder, and attempts to identify local vs external URLs based on origin or relative path structure.

### 3.7. Security Considerations (Current & Future)

* **CORS:** Currently allows `*` for origin. **CRITICAL:** Must be restricted in production via `wrangler.toml` or dynamic checks in the code to only allow requests from your specific frontend domains.
* **Authentication:** `getUserData` currently has no real authentication. Implementing secure session cookie validation (potentially involving server-to-server calls to PHP SSO using secrets/API keys stored in Wrangler secrets) is the highest priority security task remaining for the BFF.
* **Input Validation:** Although minimal input is processed now, future endpoints (e.g., profile updates) will require rigorous input validation and sanitization.
* **Error Handling:** Basic `try...catch` exists, but more specific error handling and logging should be added. Avoid leaking sensitive error details in responses.

### 3.8. Troubleshooting Notes

* Initial attempts using `itty-router` resulted in persistent `hanging Promise` / `script will never generate a response` errors in the `wrangler dev` environment, even with minimal router configurations.
* Reverting to manual routing within the `fetch` handler resolved these runtime errors. The exact cause of the `itty-router` incompatibility in this specific dev environment was not pinpointed but is bypassed by the current manual routing approach.
* Build errors related to `npm run build` were resolved by ensuring the script was defined in `package.json` (`"build": "tsc -p ."`) and that `tsconfig.json` was present and correctly configured in the project root.

## 4. Shared Header Client-Side Implementation

### 4.1. Strategy: Client-Side JS Rendering

The chosen strategy for integrating the shared header into static HTML sites and potentially legacy applications involves:

1.  A central API (`/api/header-data` provided by the BFF).
2.  A shared client-side JavaScript file (`render-header.js`) hosted centrally.
3.  A shared CSS file (`shared-header.css`) hosted centrally.
4.  An HTML placeholder (`<div id="shared-header-placeholder">`) on each consuming page.

### 4.2. Required Files

* **`render-header.js`**:
    * Fetches data from the BFF API (`HEADER_API_URL`).
    * Dynamically generates the header HTML structure using descriptive CSS class names (e.g., `.shared-header`, `.nav-item`).
    * Injects the generated HTML into the placeholder div.
    * Handles theme initialization and toggling (`localStorage`, `<html>` class manipulation).
    * Handles dropdown menu click events and visibility toggling (adding/removing `.is-open` class).
    * Includes logic for logo fallbacks.
    * *(See canvas `render-header-js` for full code)*
* **`shared-header.css`**:
    * Contains all necessary CSS rules to style the header elements based on the classes generated by `render-header.js`.
    * Uses CSS variables for theming (light/dark modes defined).
    * Includes layout rules (Flexbox) for horizontal arrangement and edge snapping.
    * Defines styles for navigation items, links, dropdowns (including visibility based on `.is-open`), placeholders, user area, action buttons, and basic responsiveness.
    * *(See canvas `shared-header-css` for full code)*

### 4.3. Hosting Strategy for Shared Assets

The `render-header.js` and `shared-header.css` files **must** be hosted in a single, publicly accessible location. Recommended options:

1.  **Cloudflare R2:** Create a public bucket or serve via a custom domain. (Cost-effective, performant).
2.  **Main Hub Assets:** Place files in the `public`/`static` folder of your deployed main frontend hub application (e.g., on Cloudflare Pages).
3.  **GitHub Pages:** Create a dedicated repository for shared assets and enable GitHub Pages.

Google Drive is **not** a suitable option.

### 4.4. Integration Steps for Static HTML Sites

1.  Add the placeholder: `<div id="shared-header-placeholder">...</div>` to the `<body>`.
2.  Link the central CSS file in the `<head>`: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="URL_TO_SHARED_HEADER_CSS">`.
3.  Include the central JS file at the end of the `<body>`: `<script src="URL_TO_RENDER_HEADER_JS" defer></script>`.
4.  Ensure the `HEADER_API_URL` and `WORKER_BASE_URL` constants within the hosted `render-header.js` point to the correct deployed BFF Worker URL.

### 4.5. Theme Handling

* Uses `localStorage` (`THEME_STORAGE_KEY`) to persist user preference.
* Checks `localStorage`, then the API hint (`themePreference`), then `prefers-color-scheme` media query to determine initial theme.
* Applies `.dark` or `.light` class to `<html>` element.
* CSS uses variables (`--header-bg`, etc.) defined within `:root` and `html.dark` scopes.
* Theme toggle button click listener in `render-header.js` updates `localStorage` and calls `applyTheme`.

### 4.6. Dropdown Handling

* Dropdown triggers (links with `data-toggle="dropdown"` attribute) are handled by a click listener attached to the header container in `render-header.js`.
* The script prevents default link behavior, toggles an `.is-open` class on the parent `.nav-item`, and closes other dropdowns.
* A document-level listener closes dropdowns on clicks outside the header.
* CSS rule `.nav-item.has-dropdown.is-open > .dropdown-menu { display: block; }` controls visibility.

## 5. Future Considerations & Next Steps

* **Authentication Implementation:** Prioritize implementing secure cookie validation in `getUserData` and interaction with the PHP SSO service.
* **Dynamic Data Sources:** Migrate branding and navigation data fetching away from placeholders/static definitions to dynamic sources.
* **Error Handling & Logging:** Implement more robust error handling and logging within the BFF.
* **Testing:** Add unit and integration tests for the BFF API logic.
* **CORS Restriction:** Configure specific allowed origins for CORS in production.
* **Caching:** Implement granular caching for the `/api/header-data` response (e.g., using Cache API for navigation, `no-store` for user data).
* **Modern Hub/Legacy App Integration:** Adapt the header implementation strategy for the Next.js/Svelte hub (likely using native components fetching from the API) and legacy PHP apps (potentially using the same client-side script approach as static sites).
* **CSS Refinement:** Continue refining `shared-header.css` for improved styling, responsiveness, and accessibility. Consider advanced CSS features or potentially integrating a utility framework build step if complexity increases significantly.
